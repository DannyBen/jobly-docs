# Scaffolding

Jobly comes with a simple scaffolding command to get you started quickly with a proper directory structure for a jobs workspace.

Run:

```bash
$ jobly init myjobs
```

in order to create a jobs workspace inside the `myjobs` directory, or:

```bash
$ jobly init --help
```

for additional options.
