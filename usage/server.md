# Server

To start the server run `jobly server` and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

This will start a webserver with two primary entrypoints:

* `/` \(root\) - a dashboard for your background job processes.
* `/do/JobName?param=value` - an API for executing jobs
