# Configuration

Configuring Jobly can be done by one of two methods:

1. Setting environment variables.
2. Adding a `./config/jobly.rb` file.

See this [example config file](/examples/02-full/config/jobly.rb) for a full,
annotated configuration example and a list of options with their respective
environment variables.
