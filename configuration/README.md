# Configuration

Configuring Jobly can be done by one of two methods:

1. Setting environment variables.
2. Adding a `./config/jobly.rb` file.

See this [example config file](https://github.com/DannyBen/jobly-docs/tree/3064beae6ab00055841f8b33b7631dcf0694993a/examples/02-full/config/jobly.rb) for a full, annotated configuration example and a list of options with their respective environment variables.
